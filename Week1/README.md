Embedded Code Debugging Tools & Tips:
* Break Points.
* Step In, Step Out, Step Over.
* Call Stack Usage.
* Watch Windows (with the Drag & Drop feature).
* Memory Windows (Observing the flash memory in the microcontroller, obtaining the base addresses of the flash memory and the RAM, reading data at some address in the RAM, and more).
* Copy flash memory content to SRAM (const data are stored in the flash memory).
